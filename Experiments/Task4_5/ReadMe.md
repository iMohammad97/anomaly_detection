# Task 4 and 5
## Task4: Comparison of LSTM based AutoEncoder and Transformer based AutoEncoder
## Task5: Comparison of LSTM based AutoEncoder and LSTM based SAutoEncoder

In task 4 we run LSTM_AE and Transformer_AE on our time-series run list of one TS from each anomaly type.

We also ran each method with different loss functions (MSE, MaxDiff).

In task 5 we run LSTM_AE and LSTM_SAE on our time-series run list of one TS from each anomaly type.
Because we only have MSE in SAE right now we dont compare them on MaxDiff yet.
